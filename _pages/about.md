Hi! I'm a joint PhD student at [Chennai Mathematical Institute](http://www.cmi.ac.in) and [IAI, TCG CREST](https://www.tcgcrest.org/institutes/iai/), advised by [Kuldeep S. Meel](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~meel/). Currently, I am a visiting graduate student at the [University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/).

My work explores the quantitative dimensions of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). I'm interested about extending SMT solvers to answer quantitative queries and developing techniques for sampling from SMT solution spaces. We have developed counting tools for hybrid SMT formulas [[DAC'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07059), [pact](https://github.com/meelgroup/pact)], bit-vectors formulas [[SMT'24](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3725/short2.pdf), [csb](https://github.com/meelgroup/csb)]
and Skolem functions [[AAAI'24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12026), [SkolemFC](https://github.com/meelgroup/skolemfc)].
Out of these, [csb](https://github.com/meelgroup/csb) can do sampling from bit-vector formulas as well.

I'm particularly enthusiastic about seeing my research make real-world impact. If you believe my tools or research might benefit your work, please get in touch!

My curiosity extends to understanding the inner workings of automated reasoning systems. I've used causality to gain insights into SAT solvers [[SAT'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06294)], investigated the behavior of model counters on practical instances [[KR'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07059)], and designed innovative phase selection heuristics for SAT solvers [[SAT'20](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01499)].
